      <p>Before hiring me to create your website I'm sure you'd like to know what I can do.</p>
      <p>I've been building websites on squarespace for two years. When it comes to design I can be as flexible as needed in order to show off the best qualities of your business. I'm not afraid of a challenge, but if something seems above my pay grade, I will let you know upfront.</p>
      <p>I'm currently learning html, css, and javascript. As soon as I'm confident in my ability to provide a quality product using those programing tools I will be available for hire in those areas as well.</p>
